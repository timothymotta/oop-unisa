Hey, 
- I've been working on this assignment on both of my laptops (ACER and DELL). So I've been committing, pushing, and pulling to/from github with 
both laptops.
- I did more than 10 commits for 10 days but I'm not sure if it will show it in the local .git folder (I'm uploading from my DELL's git repo clone).
- I just put this file here because I dont want to be accused of not doing the 10 commits.
